# 1.Basic Definitions
`Database`: A collection of related data
`Data`: Known facts that can be recorded and have an implicit meaning
`Mini-world`: some part of the real world about which data is stored in a database.For example, student grades and transcripts at a university.
`Database Management System(DBMS)`: A software package to facilitate the creation and maintenance of a computerized database
`Database System`: The DBMS software together with the data itself

# 2.Main Characteristics of Database Technology
`Self-contained` nature of a database system: A DBMS catalog stores the description of the database. The description is called meta-data.This allows the DBMS software to work with different databases.

`Insulation between programs and data`: Called program-data independence. Allows changing data storage structures without having to change the DBMS access programs.
