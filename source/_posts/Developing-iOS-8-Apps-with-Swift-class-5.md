# Objective-C Compatibility

### Bridging

  iOS was developed in a language called Objective-C.
  
  Virtually all of the iOS API is accessible seamlessly from Swift.
  
  A few special data types are handled specially (and powerfully) via bridging.
  
  Bridging means that you can use the interchangeably.

 - NSString is bridged to String

 - NSArray is bridged to Array<AnyObject>

 - NSDictionary is bridged to Dictionary<NSObject, AnyObject>

 - Int, Float, Double, Bool are all bridged to NSNumber (but not vice-versa)
 
  To get from NSNumber to these types use doubleValue, intValue, etc.

  Int, Float, Double also bridged to the C types int, float, double

### Casting to/from bridged types

 - You can also "cast" (reliably, i.e. no need for as?) to/from a bridged type
 

 ```swift
  let length = (aString as NSString).length // length is an NSString method (be careful!)
  (anArray as NSArray).componentsJoinedByString(NSString) // cjbs is a NSArray method
 ```
 
- String, Array and Dictionary are structs, not objects (classes)

  But they can still be an AnyObject
  
  That's because they are bridged to these NS versions which are objects

- The keys in an NSDictionary are NSObject subclasses (Dictionary<NSObject, AnyObject>)

  But that does not prevent a Swift String from being a key in an NSDictionary
  
  That's because it is bridged to NSString which does inherit from NSObject

- You won't even notice this bridging 99% of the tim


## Property List

### What is a Property List?
Property List 可以用于泛型

- Property List is really just the definition of a term

  It means an AnyObject which is known to be a collection of objects which are ONLY one of …
     NSString, NSArray, NSDictionary, NSNumber, NSData, NSDate
     
  e.g. an NSDictionary whose keys were NSString and values were NSArray of NSDate is one

- In Swift, the definition of Property List is exactly the same and the bridging all works

  Handling Property Lists usually requires a fair amount of casting (i.e. is and as)
  
  That's because it's an AnyObject, so you have to figure out if it's what you expect

- Property Lists are used to pass around data "blindly"

  The semantics of the contents of a Property List are known only to its creator

- Property Lists are also used as a "generic data structure"

  And so can be passed to API that reads/writes generic data …

## NSUserDefaults

### A storage mechanism for Property List data

- It's essentially a very `tiny database` that stores Propery List data.

  It persists between launchings of your application!
  
  Great for things like "settings" and such.
  
  Do not use it for anything big!

- It can store/retrieve entire Property Lists by name (keys) …


 ```swift
  setObject(AnyObject, forKey: String) // the AnyObject must be a Property List
  objectForKey(String) -> AnyObject?
  arrayForKey(String) -> Array<AnyObject>? // returns nil if value is not set or not an array
  ```
  
- It can also store/retrieve little pieces of data …


 ```swift
  setDouble(Double, forKey: String)
  doubleForKey(String) -> Double // not an optional, returns 0 if no such key 
   ```
###Using NSUserDefaults
- Get the defaults reader/writer …
 
 ```swift
  let defaults = NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults()
 ```
  
- Then read and write …
 
 ```swift
  let plist: AnyObject = defaults.objectForKey(String)
  defaults.setObject(AnyObject, forKey: String) // AnyObject must be a PropertyList
 ```
 
- Your changes will be automatically saved.
 
  But you can be sure they are saved at any time by synchronizing …

  if !defaults.synchronize() { /* failed! not much you can do about it */ }
  
  (it's not "free" to synchronize, but it's not that expensive either)


#Demo

### Add a public property, program, to CalculatorBrain

  It sets or gets the CalculatorBrain's "program".
  
  It will be a Property List (i.e. AnyObject, but built from known pieces).
  
  Callers won't have any idea what kind of object it is!
  
  The value is only good for saving/resetting the CalculatorBrain's program.


# Views

### A view (i.e. UIView subclass) represents a rectangular area

  Defines a coordinate space
  
  For drawing
  
  And for handling touch events
  
### Hierarchical

  A view has only one superview … var superview: UIView?
  
  But it can have many (or zero) subviews … var subviews: [UIView] *
  
     * aside: it's actually [AnyObject], but on slides, I'll note what is actually in an array
  
  The order in the subviews array matters: those later in the array are on top of those earlier
  
  A view can clip its subviews to its own bounds or not (the default is not to)
  
### UIWindow
  The UIView at the very, very top of the view hierarchy (even includes status bar)
  
  Usually only one UIWindow in an entire iOS application … it's all about views, not windows

### The hierarchy is most often constructed in Xcode graphically

  Even custom views are usually added to the view hierarchy using Xcode
  
### But it can be done in code as well

 ```swift
  addSubview(aView: UIView) // sent to aView's (soon to be) superview
  removeFromSuperview() // this is sent to the view you want to remove (not its superview)
  ```
### Where does the view hierarchy start?

  The top of the (useable) view hierarchy is the Controller's var view: UIView.
  
  This simple property is a very important thing to understand!
  
  This view is the one whose bounds will change on rotation, for example.
  
  This view is likely the one you will programmatically add subviews to (if you ever do that).
  
  All of your MVC's View's UIViews will have this view as an ancestor.
  
  It's automatically hooked up for you when you create an MVC in Xcode. 


# Initializing a UIView

### As always, try to avoid an initializer if possible

  But having one in UIView is slightly more common than having a UIViewController initializer
  
### A UIView's initializer is different if it comes out of a storyboard

 ```swift
  init(frame: CGRect) // initializer if the UIView is created in code
  init(coder: NSCoder) // initializer if the UIView comes out of a storyboard
  ```
  
### If you need an initializer, implement them both …

```swift
  func setup() { … }

  override init(frame: CGRect) { // a designed initializer
      super.init(frame: frame)
      setup()
  } 
  required init(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) { // a required initializer
      super.init(coder: aDecoder)
      setup()
  }
  ```
  
### Another alternative to initializers in UIView …

```swift
  awakeFromNib() // this is only called if the UIView came out of a storyboard
```

  This is not an initializer (it's called immediately after initialization is complete)
  
  All objects that inherit from NSObject in a storyboard are sent this (if they implement it)
  
  Order is not guaranteed, so you cannot message any other objects in the storyboard here

# Coordinate System Data Structures
 
### CGFloat
 
  - Always use this instead of Double or Float for anything to do with a UIView’s coordinate system
  
  -  You can convert from a Double or Float using 
 
    ```swift
     let cfg = CGFloat(aDouble)
   ``` 
 
###CGPoint
 
  Simply a struct with two CGFloats in it: x and y.
  
  ```swift
  var point = CGPoint(x: 37.0, y: 55.2)
  point.y -= 30
  point.x += 20.0
  ```
  
###CGSize
 
  Also a struct with two CGFloats in it: width and height.
  
  ```swift
  var size = CGSize(width: 100.0, height: 50.0)
  size.width += 42.5
  size.height += 75
  ```
  
### CGRect
 
  A struct with a CGPoint and a CGSize in it …
  ```swift
  struct CGRect {
     var origin: CGPoint
     var size: CGSize
  }
  let rect = CGRect(origin: aCGPoint, size: aCGSize) // there are other inits as well
  ```
  Lots of convenient properties and functions on CGRect like …
  ```swift
  var minX: CGFloat // left edge
  var midY: CGFloat // midpoint vertically
  intersects(CGRect) -> Bool // does this CGRect intersect this other one?
  intersect(CGRect) // clip the CGRect to the intersection with the other one
  contains(CGPoint) -> Bool // does the CGRect contain the given CGPoint?
  ```
  … and many more (make yourself a CGRect and type . after it to see more)

#  View Coordinate System

### Origin is upper left

### Units are points, not pixels

  Pixels are the minimum-sized unit of drawing your device is capable of
  
  Points are the units in the coordinate system
  
  Most of the time there are 2 pixels per point, but it could be only 1 or something else
  
  How many pixels per point are there? UIView’s var contentScaleFactor: CGFloat
  
### The boundaries of where drawing happens

  ```swift
  var bounds: CGRect // a view's internal drawing space's origin and size
  ```
  This is the rectangle containing the drawing space in its own coordinate system
  
  It is up to your view's implementation to interpret what bounds.origin means (often nothing)
  
### Where is the UIView?

 ```swift
  var center: CGPoint // the center of a UIView in its superview's coordinate system
  var frame: CGRect // the rect containing a UIView in its superview's coordinate system 
 ```

# bounds vs frame 
### Use frame and/or center to position a UIView 

- These are never used to draw inside a view's coordinate system (i.e. for positioning only)
  
  You might think frame.size is always equal to bounds.size, but you'd be wrong … 

- Views can be rotated (and scaled and translated) 

  View B's bounds = ((0,0),(200,250)) 
  
  View B's frame = ((140,65),(320,320))
  
  View B's center = (300,225) 

- View B's middle in its own coordinates is … 

  (bounds.midX, bounds.midY) = (100, 125)
  
- Views are rarely rotated, but don't misuse frame or center anyway by assuming that.

# Creating Views 

### Most often your views are created via your storyboard

  Xcode's Object Palette has a generic UIView you can drag out
  
  After you do that, you must use the Identity Inspector to changes its class to your subclass 
  
### On rare occasion, you will create a UIView via code 

- You can use the frame initializer … 
 
  ```swift 
  let newView=UIView(frame:myViewFrame)
  ```
  
- Or you can just use

  ```swift
  let newView=UIView()(frame will be CGRectZero)
  ```
  
### Example 

```swift
   // assuming this code is in a UIViewController
   let labelRect=CGRect(x:20,y:20,width:100,height:50)
   let label=UILabel(frame:labelRect)// UILabel is a subclass of UIView
   label.text="Hello"
   view.addSubview(label)
```


# Custom Views
### When would I create my own UIView subclass?
  I want to do some custom drawing on screen
  
  I need to handle touch events in a special way (i.e. different than a button or slider does)
  
  We'll talk about handling touch events in a bit. First we'll focus on drawing.
  
### To draw, just create a UIView subclass and override drawRect:

```swift
  override func drawRect(regionThatNeedsToBeDrawn: CGRect)
```
  You can draw outside the regionThatNeedsToBeDrawn, but it's never required
  
  The regionThatNeedsToBeDrawn is purely an optimization
  
### NEVER call drawRect!! EVER! Or else!
  Instead, if you view needs to be redrawn, let the system know that by calling …
  
```swift
  setNeedsDisplay()
  setNeedsDisplayInRect(regionThatNeedsToBeRedrawn: CGRect)
```
  iOS will then call your drawRect at an appropriate time
  
### So how do I implement my drawRect?

  You can use a C-like (non object-oriented) API called Core Graphics
  
  Or you can use the object-oriented UIBezierPath class (which is how we’ll do it)
  
### Core Graphics Concepts

  You get a context to draw into (could be printing context, drawing context, etc.)
  
  The function UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext() gives a context you can use in drawRect
  
  Create paths (out of lines, arcs, etc.)
  
  Set drawing attributes like colors, fonts, textures, linewidths, linecaps, etc.
  
  Stroke or fill the above-created paths with the given attributes
  
### UIBezierPath
  Same as above, but captures all the drawing with a UIBezierPath instance
  
  UIBezierPath automatically draws in the "current" context (drawRect sets this up for you)
  
  Methods for adding to the UIBezierPath (lineto, arcs, etc.) and setting linewidth, etc.
  
  Methods to stroke or fill the UIBezierPath

# Defining a Path

### Create a UIBezierPath

```Swift
  let path = UIBezierPath()
```
### Move around, add lines or arcs to the path

```swift
  path.moveToPoint(CGPoint(80, 50))       // assume screen is 160x250
  path.addLineToPoint(CGPoint(140, 150))
  path.addLineToPoint(CGPoint(10, 150))
```  
###  Close the path (if you want)

```swift
  path.closePath()
```  
### Now that you have a path, set attributes and stroke/fill

```swift
  UIColor.greenColor().setFill()  // note this is a method in UIColor, not UIBezierPath
  UIColor.redColor().setStroke()  // note this is a method in UIColor, not UIBezierPath
  path.linewidth = 3.0            // note this is a property in UIBezierPath, not UIColor
  path.fill()
  path.stroke()
```

# Drawing

### You can also draw common shapes with UIBezierPath

```swift
  let roundRect = UIBezierPath(roundedRect: aCGRect, cornerRadius: aCGFloat)
  let oval = UIBezierPath(ovalInRect: aCGRect)
```  
  … and others
### Clipping your drawing to a UIBezierPath's path 

```swift
  addClip()
```  

  For example, you could clip to a rounded rect to enforce the edges of a playing card
  
### Hit detection

```swift
  func containsPoint(CGPoint) -> Bool // returns whether the point is inside the path
```  

  The path must be closed. The winding rule can be set with usesEvenOddFillRule property.
  
### Etc.

  Lots of other stuff. Check out the documentation.


# UIColor
### Colors are set using UIColor
  There are type methods for standard colors, e.g. let green = UIColor.greenColor()
  
  You can also create them from RGB, HSB or even a pattern (using UIImage)
### Background color of a UIView

```swift
  var backgroundColor: UIColor
```
### Colors can have alpha (transparency)

  ```swift
  let transparentYellow = UIColor.yellowColor().colorWithAlphaComponent(0.5)
  ```
  Alpha is between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque)
  
### If you want to draw in your view with transparency …

  You must let the system know by setting the UIView var opaque = false
  
### You can make your entire UIView transparent …

 ```swift
  var alpha: CGFloat
 ```

# View Transparency

### What happens when views overlap and have transparency?

  As mentioned before, subviews list order determines who is in front
  
  Lower ones (earlier in the array) can "show through" transparent views on top of them
  
  Transparency is not cheap, by the way, so use it wisely
  
### Completely hiding a view without removing it from hierarchy

 ```swift
  var hidden: Bool
 ```
  A hidden view will draw nothing on screen and get no events either
  
  Not as uncommon as you might think to temporarily hide a view


# Drawing Text

### Usually we use a UILabel to put text on screen

  But there are certainly occasions where we want to draw text in our drawRect
  
### To draw in drawRect, use NSAttributedString

 ```swift
  let text = NSAttributedString("hello")
  text.drawAtPoint(aCGPoint)
  let textSize: CGSize = text.size // how much space the string will take up
  ```
### Mutability is done with NSMutableAttributedString

  It is not like String (i.e. where let means immutable and var means mutable)
  
  You use a different class if you want to make a mutable attributed string …
  ```swift
  let mutableText = NSMutableAttributedString("some string")
  ```
### NSAttributedString is not a String, nor an NSString

  You can get its contents as an NSString with its string or mutableString property


# Attributed String

### Setting attributes on an attributed string

```swift
  func setAttributes(attributes: Dictionary, range: NSRange)
  func addAttributes(attributes: Dictionary, range: NSRange)
```
  Warning! This is a pre-Swift API. NSRange is not a Range.
  
  And indexing into the string is using old-style indexing (not String.Index).
  
### Attributes

```swift
  NSForegroundColorAttributeName : UIColor
  NSStrokeWidthAttributeName : CGFloat
  NSFontAttributeName : UIFont
```
  See the documentation under NSAttributedString(NSStringDrawing) for (many) more. 

# Fonts

### Fonts in iOS 7 and later are very important to get right!

  They are fundamental to the look and feel of the UI
  
### The absolutely best way to get a font in code

  Get preferred font for a given text style (e.g. body, etc.) using this UIFont type method …
  
 ```swift
  class func preferredFontForTextStyle(UIFontTextStyle) -> UIFont
 ```
  Some of the styles (see UIFontDescriptor documentation for more) …
  
 ```swift
  UIFontTextStyle.Headline
  UIFontTextStyle.Body
  UIFontTextStyle.Footnote
 ```
 
### There are also "system fonts"

  These appear usually on things like buttons
  
 ```swift
  class func systemFontOfSize(pointSize: CGFloat) -> UIFont
  class func boldSystemFontOfSize(pointSize: CGFloat) -> UIFont
  ```
  Don't use these for your user's content. Use preferred fonts for that.
  
### Other ways to get fonts

  Check out UIFont and UIFontDescriptor for more, but you should not need that very often



# Drawing Images

### There is a UILabel-equivalent for images

 ```swift
  UIImageView
 ``` 
  But, again, you might want to draw the image inside your drawRect …
  
### Creating a UIImage object

 ```swift
  let image: UIImage? = UIImage(named: "foo")    // note that its optional
 ``` 
  You add foo.jpg to your project in the Images.xcassets file (we've ignored this so far)
  
  Images will have different resolutions for different devices (all managed in Images.xcassets)
  
### You can also create one from files in the file system

  (But we haven't talked about getting at files in the file system … anyway …)
  
  ```swift
  let image: UIImage? = UIImage(contentsOfFile: aString)
  let image: UIImage? = UIImage(data: anNSData) // raw jpg, png, tiff, etc. image data
  ```
  
### You can even create one by drawing with Core Graphics

  See documentation for UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(CGSize)
  
### Once you have a UIImage, you can blast its bits on screen

 ```swift
  let image: UIImage = …
  image.drawAtPoint(aCGPoint) // the upper left corner of the image put at aCGPoint
  image.drawInRect(aCGRect) // scales the image to fit aCGRect
  image.drawAsPatternInRect(aCGRect) // tiles the image into aCGRect
 ```



# Redraw on bounds change?
### By default, when a UIView’s bounds changes, there is no redraw
  Instead, the "bits" of the existing image are scaled to the new bounds size
### This is often not what you want …
  Luckily, there is a UIView property to control this! It can be set in Xcode too.
  
  ```swift
  var contentMode: UIViewContentMode
  ```
### UIViewContentMode

  Don't scale the view, just place it somewhere …
  
  ```swift
  .Left/.Right/.Top/.Bottom/.TopRight/.TopLeft/.BottomRight/.BottomLeft/.Center
  ```
  Scale the "bits" of the view …
  
  ```swift
  .ScaleToFill/.ScaleAspectFill/.ScaleAspectFit // .ScaleToFill is the default
  ```
  
  Redraw by calling drawRect again
  
 ```swift
  .Redraw
 ```


# Demo
### FaceView
  Create a custom UIView subclass to draw a face with a specified amount of "smiliness"

Property Observer
```swift
var lineWidth:CGFloat = 3{
	didSet{setNeedsDisplay()}
}
当property发生改变时，会响应消息
```
