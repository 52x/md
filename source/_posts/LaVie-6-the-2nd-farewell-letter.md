Say goodbye to my third company.

<!-- more -->

Hey,
 
I’m leaving Shanghai soon and will finally have family reunion with my wife and my son.

Last time when I left my former employer, I drafted a long farewell letter full of jokes (*believe me they are funny*)…
However, today I immerse myself in the emotion of leaving, leaving my beloved team and mates (*yeah, you know I love you all. But I’m married, I’m not available, don’t stare at me Jon*), even the desk, the computer (*want to carry them home…*) and the view from the height of 35th floor (*which I can’t take away…*).
 
To say goodbye is to die a little - Raymond Chandler says in his book “The Long Goodbye”. It’s a cruel comment (*yes, the sensational words you expected…*).
I believe the end of a story is important but can never overshadow the diverse possibilities in the dazzling future.
 
Keep in touch (*still struggling in the mood…*).

Best wishes,

PapaCochon
