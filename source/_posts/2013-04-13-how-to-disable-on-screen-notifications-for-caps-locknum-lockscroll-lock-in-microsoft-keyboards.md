Normally, I wouldn't even have bothered, but during playing Battlefield 3 (or other full-screen games), if you happen to hit Caps lock, this popup will cause the game to run in window mode (and having you killed in the process!).

I have a Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 7000, and if your popup looks like the one in the image above, you can disable it with the [Microsoft IntelliType](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26949) software.

Here's how to disable those annoying on-screen notifications for caps lock, scroll lock and num lock from appearing on your screen:

  1. If you haven't already, download and install [Microsoft IntelliType](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26949)
  2. Open it by typing *Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard* in Start menu/screen, and select your keyboard
  3. Point your mouse cursor on the key you want to disable (CAPS LOCK, for example):
  
    <img style="display: inline;" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/hmemcpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/image5.png?resize=636%2C480" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />
  4. Click the highlighted CAPS LOCK entry (or click on the CAPS LOCK button with the mouse, and DISABLE *Display CAPS LOCK status on the screen*:  
    <img style="display: inline;" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/hmemcpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/image6.png?resize=636%2C480" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />
  5. Repeat the process for other keys, if you want
  6. Enjoy bother-free gaming!
