I speak Russian, but I never bothered to learn how to properly type it on the keyboard. Every time I needed to search or write something, I would use a transliteration service, such as <a href="http://www.translit.ru" target="_blank">translit.ru</a>, then copy the translated text to clipboard and paste it to the target window (such as a Skype chat session).

Here is how it works: after installing Google IME <a href="http://www.google.com/ime/transliteration/" target="_blank">in your language</a>, you will have that language added in your languages bar. Then, when you switch to that language using Alt-Shift, you then can type in English letters, and Google IME will automatically convert it to the target language (even suggesting the correct spelling if you made a mistake!).

Suppose I want to type *который час* (*what time is it?*). I switch to the Russian language, then type the word *kotoryj*:
{% asset_img image2.png %}

Upon pressing space, the first option will be selected, and _kotoryj_ will be replaced with _который_. This works everywhere, from input fields to Word documents! When I'm done, I switch back to English using Alt-Shift.

Horosho!
