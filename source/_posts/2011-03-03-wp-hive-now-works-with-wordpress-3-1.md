<a href="http://wp-hive.com/" target="_blank">WP Hive</a> users rejoice! John Sessford (ikailo), the original author of WP Hive, who had <a href="http://wp-hive.com/wp-hive-needs-new-owner/" target="_blank">stopped development</a> of the plugin, came to the rescue of users who depended on this plugin, and were [unable to upgrade](/2011/02/urgent-warning-do-not-upgrade-to-wordpress-3-1-with-wp-hive-installed/) to WordPress 3.1.

In a <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/upgrade-to-31-wp_cache_get-issue?replies=24#post-1974988" target="_blank">post</a> on the WordPress support forum, John asked to test a version of the plugin, to make sure it works in both 3.0.5 and 3.1. Yours truly had done so (after performing a complete backup!), and I am pleased to say that the plugin **works in both versions of WordPress!**

To install it, <a href="http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/wp-hive.0.6.2.zip" target="_blank">download the plugin</a>, then in the Plugins pane _deactivate_, then _delete_ the previous version (0.6.1) of WP Hive (don't worry &ndash; your settings are not removed). Then press **Add New**, then click on **Upload**, and upload **wp-hive.0.6.2.zip** you've downloaded earlier.

After this you can safely upgrade to WordPress 3.1, and enjoy it's <a href="http://wordcastnet.com/2011/wordpress-3-1-released-wordcasts-ultimate-guide-to-whats-new/" target="_blank">awesome new features</a>!
