One day, my 9 years old sister Amy asked me:"You said that you have been working on a product that can recognise who a person is when he shows himself in front of a computer. Have you worked it out?"

"Well, "I said, "nope. We are still working on it." Dispite 3 years of doing research on computer vision, I still cannot present a visible and usable product with friendly UI to entertain my sister. However, I don't want to let her down, so I plan to develop a small smart product named "Amuse", which stands for "Amy-Use" and "Entertainment". Not for commercial, just for fan, and if can, for assistanting scientific research.

A minimum viable product (MVP) of "Amuse" would be like this:

## MVP

- version 1.1
    + "Hi, Amuse, I am Chris."
    + "Hi, Chris."

- version 1.2
    + "Hi, Amuse, what am I doing?"
    + "Hi, Chris, you are drinking coke."

- version 1.3
    + "Hi, Amuse, this is my girlfriend."
    + "Hi, it's nice to meet you. What's your name?"
    + "I am Janny."
    + "Hi, Janny."
