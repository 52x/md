Here is something I wish I'd known years ago &#8211; you can make the *View Source* action default when you double click on a WinForm control.

<!-- more -->

**Here's how:**

  1. Right click any Form/UserControl file, and choose **Open With...** 
  2. Select **CSharp Editor**, then press **Set as Default** 
  3. ???? 
  4. Profit! 

That's it! Now you won't break the keyboard when you accidentally double click on your `MainForm.cs` file.
