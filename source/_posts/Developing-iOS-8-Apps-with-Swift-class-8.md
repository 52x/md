## View Controller Lifecycle
### View Controllers have a "Lifecycle"
  A sequence of messages is sent to a View Controller as it progresses through its "lifetime".
### Why does this matter?
  You very commonly override these methods to do certain work.
### The start of the lifecycle …
  Creation.
  
  MVCs are most often instantiated out of a storyboard (as you've seen).
  
  There are ways to do it in code (rare) as well which we may cover later in the quarter.
  
### What then?
 - Preparation if being segued to.
  
 - Outlet setting.
  
 - Appearing and disappearing.
  
 - Geometry changes.
  
 - Low-memory situations.
  

### After instantiation and outlet-setting, viewDidLoad is called
outlet此时已经设置完成
 - This is an exceptionally good place to put a lot of setup code.
 
   It's better than an init because your outlets are all set up by the time this is called.
   记得调用super的viewDidLoad 
```swift
  override func viewDidLoad() {
      super.viewDidLoad()  // always let super have a chance in lifecycle methods
      // do some setup of my MVC
  }
 ``` 

 - One thing you may well want to do here is update your UI from your Model.
 
   Because now you know all of your outlets are set.

 - But be careful because the geometry of your view (its bounds) is not set yet!
 
   At this point, you can't be sure you're on an iPhone 5-sized screen or an iPad or ???.

   `So do not initialize things that are geometry-dependent here.`
   有关几何位置的初始化不能再viewDidLoad中操作！

### Just before your view appears on screen, you get notified
```swift
  func viewWillAppear(animated: Bool) // animated is whether you are appearing over time
```
 -  Your view will only get "loaded" once, but it might appear and disappear a lot.
   
    So don't put something in this method that really wants to be in viewDidLoad.

    Otherwise, you might be doing something over and over unnecessarily.

 - Do something here if things your display is changing while your MVC is off-screen.
  
 - You could use this to optimize performance by waiting until this method is called
    (as opposed to viewDidLoad) to kick off an expensive operation (probably in another thread).

 - Your view's geometry is set here, but there are other places to react to geometry.
 

###There is a "did" version of this as well

```swift
  func viewDidAppear(animated: Bool)
```
### And you get notified when you will disappear off screen too
  This is where you put "remember what's going on" and cleanup code.
```swift
  override func viewWillDisappear(animated: Bool) {
     super.viewWillDisappear(animated) // call super in all the viewWill/Did... methods
     // do some clean up now that we've been removed from the screen
     // but be careful not to do anything time-consuming here, or app will be sluggish
     // maybe even kick off a thread to do stuff here (again, we'll cover threads later)
  }
```
### There is a "did" version of this too
```swift
  func viewDidDisappear(animated: Bool)
```
### Geometry changed?
  Most of the time this will be automatically handled with Autolayout.
  
  But you can get involved in geometry changes directly with these methods … 
```swift
   funcviewWillLayoutSubviews()
   funcviewDidLayoutSubviews()
```
  They are called any time a view's frame changed and its subviews were thus re-layed out.
  
  For example, autorotation (more on this in a moment). 
  
  You can reset the frames of your subviews here or set other geometry-related properties.
  
  These methods might be called more often than you'd imagine
  (e.g. for pre- and post- animation arrangement, etc.).
  
  So don't do anything in here that can't properly (and efficiently) be done repeatedly.
  
#Autorotation
  - Usually, the UI changes shape when the user rotates the device between portrait/landscape
  
    You can control which orientations your app supports in the Settings of your project

  - Almost always, your UI just responds naturally to rotation with autolayout
  
  - But if you, for example, want to participate in the rotation animation, you can use this method …
```swift
  func viewWillTransitionToSize(
      size: CGSize,
      withTransitionCoordinator: UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinator
  )
```  
 
  - The coordinator provides a method to animate alongside the rotation animation
 
    We are not going to be talking about animation, though, for a couple of weeks

    So this is just something to put in the back of your mind (i.e. that it exists) for now

### In low-memory situations, didReceiveMemoryWarning gets called ...
  This rarely happens, but well-designed code with big-ticket memory uses might anticipate it.
  
  Examples: images and sounds.
  
  Anything "big" that is not currently in use and can be recreated relatively easily
    should probably be released (by setting any pointers to it to nil)
    
### awakeFromNib

  This method is sent to all objects that come out of a storyboard (including your Controller).
  
  Happens before outlets are set! (i.e. before the MVC is "loaded")
  
  Put code somewhere else if at all possible (e.g. viewDidLoad or viewWillAppear).


###Summary

 - Instantiated (from storyboard usually)
  
 - awakeFromNib
  
 - segue preparation happens
  
 - outlets get set
  
 - viewDidLoad
  
 - These pairs will be called each time your Controller's view goes on/off screen …
  
     viewWillAppear and viewDidAppear
     
     viewWillDisappear and viewDidDisappear
     
 - These "geometry changed" methods might be called at any time after viewDidLoad …
  
     viewWillLayoutSubviews (… then autolayout happens, then …) viewDidLayoutSubviews
     
 - If memory gets low, you might get …
  
     didReceiveMemoryWarning



### Demo
 
  Let's plop some println statements into the View Controller Lifecycle methods in Psychologist
  
  Then we can watch as Psychologist and Happiness MVCs go through their lifecycle



#Autolayout
### You've seen a lot of Autolayout already
 - Using the dashed blue lines to try to tell Xcode what you intend
 - Ctrl-Dragging between views to create relationships (spacing, etc.)
 - The "Pin" and "Arrange" popovers in the lower right of the storyboard
 - Reset to Suggested Constraints (if the blue lines were enough to unambiguously set constraints)
 - Document Outline (see all constraints, resolve misplacements and even conflicts)
 - Size Inspector (look at (and edit!) the details of the constraints on the selected view)
 - Clicking on a constraint to select it then bring up Attributes Inspector (to edit its details)
 

### Mastering Autolayout requires experience
  You just have to do it to learn it
  
### Autolayout can be done from code too
  Though you're probably better off doing it in the storyboard wherever possible

  The demo today will show a simple case of doing Autolayout from code
### What about rotation?
  Sometimes rotating changes the geometry so drastically that autolayout is not enough
  
  You actually need to reposition the views to make them fit properly
### Calculator
  For example, what if we had 20 buttons in a Calculator?
  
  It might be better in Landscape to have the buttons 5 across and 4 down
  
  Versus in Portrait have them 4 across and 5 down
  
### View Controllers might want this in other situations too
  For example, your MVC is the master of a side-by-side split view
  
  In that case, you'd want to draw just like a Portrait iPhone does
  
### The solution? Size Classes 
  Your View Controller always exists in a certain "size class" environment for width and height
  
  Currently this is either Compact or Regular (i.e. not compact)
### iPhone 6+
  The iPhone 6+ in Portrait orientation is Compact in width and Regular in height
  
  In Landscape, it is Compact in height and Regular in width
  
### iPhone
  Other iPhones in Portrait are also Compact in width and Regular in height
  
  But in Landscape, non-6+ iPhones are treated as Compact in both dimensions
  
### iPad
  Always Regular in both dimensions
  
  An MVC that is the master in a side-by-side split view will be Compact width, Regular height
  
### Extensible
  This whole concept is extensible to any "MVC's inside other MVC's" situation (not just split view)
  
  An MVC can find out its size class environment via this method in UIViewController …
```swift  
  let mySizeClass: UIUserInterfaceSizeClass = self.traitCollection.horizontalSizeClass
```
  The return value is an enum .Compact or .Regular (or .Unspecified).


#Demos
### ShowSizeClass
  A trivial app to take a look at how we react to size class differences in our storyboard
 对于不同的屏幕可以利用SizeClass设置布局，共有3*3种状态，每种布局仅在对应SizeClass生效。
  
### Autolayout

  Let's pull it all together by building a UI that has some Autolayout challenges
  
  Including needing to do something different in different size classes
  可以调节水平和竖直的hugging优先级，决定缩放的时候优先压缩哪个控件。
  
 本课使用`extension`扩展了User和Image类。

### A Challenge to You!

  After watching today, see if you can make your Calculator react to size class changes
  
  For example, change the number of rows and columns in different size class situations
  
  Or even show more operations in one size class or another (like Apple's Calculator app does)
