# Chapters 4 ~ 6 Deep Learning

## Neural nets can compute any function

2 caveats about universality

- given any function $f(x)$ and accuracy $\epsilon$ , using enough hidden neurons we can always find a neural network whose output $g(x)$ staisfies $\vert g(x) - f(x) \vert < \epsilon$ for all inputs $x$. Moreover, we can achieve this with a single hidden layer.
- the class of functions which can be approximated are *continuous* functions.

Summing up, neural networks with a single hidden layer can be used to approximate any continuous function to any desired precision.

> Despite of the fact above, empirical evidence suggests that deep networks are the networks best adapted to learn the functions useful in solving many real-world problems.

## Why are deep neural networks hard to train?

One of the obstacle for training deep neural networks is `vanishing gradient`.

![](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/images/tikz38.png)

Consider the simplest deep neural network shown above. Where $w_i$ and $b_i$ stand for weights and biases, $\sigma$ is the sigmoid activation function, and $C$ is the loss to be minimized. 

The derivative reaches a maximum at $\sigma'(0) = 0.25$, and we usually initialize the weights so  $\vert w_i \vert < 1$, thus the gradient get smaller when the error is propagated to the earlier layers. This is the essential origin of the vanishing gradient problem.

![](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/images/tikz39.png)

If the weights grow during training, we might have an exploding gradient problem instead.

> The real problem here is that neural networks suffer from an *unstable gradient problem*. As a result, if we use standard gradient-based learning techniques, different layers in the network will tend to learn at wildly different speeds.

In a more general deep network, the same behavior occurs as well

$$\delta^l = \Sigma'(z^l) (w^{l+1})^T \Sigma'(z^{l+1}) (w^{l+2})^T \ldots  \Sigma'(z^L) \nabla_a C$$

where the $\Sigma'(z^l)$ is a diagonal matrix whose entries are the $\sigma'(z)$ values for the weighted inputs to the *l*th layer. In practice, empirically it is typically found in sigmoid networks that gradients vanish exponentially quickly in earlier layers. As a result, learning slows down in those layers.

### The prevalence of the vanishing gradient problem.

Gradient can either vanish or explode in the early layers of a deep network, but usually they vanish. Because if we make the weights large, we might inevitably increased the $z = wa+b$ at the same time, which makes $\sigma'(z)$ very small. The only way to avoid this is to limit the input activation within a fairly narrow range of values, and most of the time it won't happen.


## Deep Learning

### Convolutional networks

CNN use three basic ideas

- local receptive fields, each neuron in the hidden layer will be connected to some sliding region of the previous layer. The sliding action might use different *stride*, or use *zero-padding*.
- shared weights and biases, all neurons in the same hidden layer detect exactly the same feature.
- pooling, pooling layers are usually used immediately after convolutional layers to simplify the information in the output from convolutional layer.

![](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/images/simple_conv.png)

Some results of experiment in this chapter, what helped to increase the accuracy

- Using convolutional layers with pooling layers
- Replacing sigmoid with ReLU activations
- Data augmentation
- Insert fully connected layers with dropout after convolutional layers
- Using ensemble of networks even the only difference is random initialization

> Regarding the use of ReLU, the reason is still empirical. We still don't have a theory to pick the best activation function. ReLU speed up the training over sigmoid by a factor of 3-5.
>
> Convolutional layers don't need dropout because they are less likely to pick up on local features.

Actually, the vanishing gradient problem hasn't be theoretically solved. But combining ReLU and GPU computing, we speed up the training tens of times faster than before, which makes it possible for early layers to learn. Together with regularization techniques such as convolutional layers and dropout, we reduced the overfitting and increased the accuracy substantially.

## Code for convolutional network

The code is implemented with `Theano`. 


```python
"""network3.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Theano-based program for training and running simple neural
networks.

Supports several layer types (fully connected, convolutional, max
pooling, softmax), and activation functions (sigmoid, tanh, and
rectified linear units, with more easily added).

When run on a CPU, this program is much faster than network.py and
network2.py.  However, unlike network.py and network2.py it can also
be run on a GPU, which makes it faster still.

Because the code is based on Theano, the code is different in many
ways from network.py and network2.py.  However, where possible I have
tried to maintain consistency with the earlier programs.  In
particular, the API is similar to network2.py.  Note that I have
focused on making the code simple, easily readable, and easily
modifiable.  It is not optimized, and omits many desirable features.

This program incorporates ideas from the Theano documentation on
convolutional neural nets (notably,
http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lenet.html ), from Misha Denil's
implementation of dropout (https://github.com/mdenil/dropout ), and
from Chris Olah (http://colah.github.io ).

Written for Theano 0.6 and 0.7, needs some changes for more recent
versions of Theano.
