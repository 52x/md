lecture 7. Multiple MVCs
   
<!-- more -->

### Multiple MVCs
Split View Controllers & Navigation Controllers & Tab Bar Controllers

Segues

Demo: Psychologist

Popovers (time permitting)

## Multiple MVCs
### Time to build more powerful applications
- To do this, we must combine MVCs …

- iOS provides some Controllers

  whose View is "other MVCs"
  
  Examples:
 
  UITabBarController 
  
  UISplitViewController
  
  UINavigationController


## UITabBarController
MVCs之间不应该有依赖，TabBar的各个mvc之间应该是同一层级的关系，而不应该是逻辑上相关的。
It lets the user choose between different MVCs …

## UISplitViewController
  Puts two MVCs side-by-side …
 Master通常决定Detail中的内容

## UINavigationController
### Pushes and pops MVCs off of a stack (like a stack of cards) …

This top area is drawn by the UINavigationController

But the contents of the top area (like the title or any buttons on the right) are determined by the MVC currently showing (in this case,the "All Settings" MVC)

Each MVC communicates these contents via its UIViewController's navigationItem property

## Accessing the sub-MVCs

### You can get the sub-MVCs via the viewControllers property!

```swift
var viewControllers: [UIViewController] { get set } // possibly an optional
```

// for a tab bar, they are in order, left to right, in the array!

// for a split view, [0] is the master and [1] is the detail!

// for a navigation controller, [0] is the root and the rest are in order on the stack!

// even though this is settable, usually setting happens via storyboard, segues, or other!

// for example, navigation controller's push and pop methods

### But how do you get ahold of the SVC, TBC or NC itself?!

Every UIViewController knows the Split View, Tab Bar or Navigation Controller it is currently in

These are UIViewController properties …

```swift
 var tabBarController: UITabBarController? { get }
 var splitViewController: UISplitViewController? { get }
 var navigationController: UINavigationController? { get } !
```
So, for example, to get the detail of the split view controller you are in …

```swift
if let detailVC: UIViewController = splitViewController?.viewControllers[1] { … }
```

## Wiring up MVCs

### How do we wire all this stuff up?
可以使用代码也可以使用storyboard拖拽连接
- Let's say we have a Calculator MVC and a Calculator Graphing MVC

  How do we hook them up to be the two sides of a Split View?

- Just drag out a SplitViewController(and delete all the extra  VCs it brings with it)

- Then ctrl-drag from the UISplitViewController to the master and detail MVCs …

### But split view can only do its thing properly on iPad
split view不能在iPhone上并排显示，需要为它添加Navigation Controllers。
  So we need to put some Navigation Controllers in there so it will work on iPhone

  The Navigation Controllers will be good for iPad too because the MVCs will get titles

  The simplest way to wrap a Navigation Controller around an MVC is with Editor->Embed In 



##Segues

### We've built up our Controllers of Controllers, now what?

Now we need to make it so that one MVC can cause another to appear

We call that a "segue"

### Kinds of segues (they will adapt to their environment)
本课程讨论如下四种segues
Show Segue (will push in a Navigation Controller, else Modal)

Show Detail Segue (will show in Detail of a Split View or will push in a Navigation Controller)

Modal Segue (take over the entire screen while the MVC is up)

Popover Segue (make the MVC appear in a little popover window)

###Segues always create a new instance of an MVC
Segues`总是`创建一个新的MVC，不会去找一个已经存在的MVC
This is important to understand

The Detail of a Split View will get replaced with a new instance of that MVC

When you segue in a Navigation Controller it will not segue to some old instance, it'll be new

### How do we make these segues happen?

Ctrl-drag in a storyboard from an instigator (like a button) to the MVC to segue to

Can be done in code as well


### What's that identifier all about?
10%在代码中可以触发identifier，但大多数情况identifier用于`prepare`segues
You would need it to invoke this segue from code using this UIViewController method
```swift
func performSegueWithIdentifier(identifier: String, sender: AnyObject?)
```
(but we almost never do this because we set usually ctrl-drag from the instigator)

The sender can be whatever you want (you'll see where it shows up in a moment)

You can ctrl-drag from the Controller itself to another Controller if you're segueing via code

(because in that case, you'll be specifying the sender above)

### More important use of the identifier: preparing for a segue

When a segue happens, the View Controller containing the instigator gets a chance
to prepare the destination View Controller to be segued to

Usually this means setting up the segued-to MVC’s Model and display characteristics

Remember that the MVC segued to is always a fresh instance (never a reused one)



## Preparing for a Segue
### The method that is called in the instigator's Controller
```swift
func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: AnyObject?) {
  if let identifier = segue.identifier {
    switch identifier {
      case "Show Graph":
      if let vc = segue.destinationViewController as? MyController {
        vc.property1 = …                 //It is crucial to understand that this preparation is happening BEFORE outlets get set!!
        vc.callMethodToSetItUp(…)        //It is a very common bug to prepare an MVC thinking its outlets are set.
      }
      default: break
    }
  }
}
```
preparation 发生在 outlets get set`之前`

- The segue passed in contains important information about this segue:

  1. the identifier from the storyboard

  2. the Controller of the MVC you are segueing to (which was just created for you)

- The sender is either the instigating object from a storyboard (e.g. a UIButton)
  or the sender you provided (see last slide) if you invoked the segue manually in code

- Here is the identifier from the storyboard (it can be nil, so be sure to check for that case)

  Your Controller might support preparing for lots of different segues from different instigators
  so this identifier is how you'll know which one you’re preparing for

- For this example, we'll assume we entered "Show Graph" in the Attributes Inspector
 when we had the segue selected in the storyboard

- Here we are looking at the Controller of the MVC we're segueing to

  It is AnyObject, so we must cast it to the Controller we (should) know it to be

- This is where the actual preparation of the segued-to MVC occurs

  Hopefully the MVC has a clear public API that it wants you to use to prepare it
  
  Once the MVC is prepared, it should run on its own power (only using delegation to talk back)


#Preventing Segues

###You can prevent a segue from happening too

 Just implement this in your UIViewController …
```swift
func shouldPerformSegueWithIdentifier(identifier: String?, sender: AnyObject?) -> Bool
```
The identifier is the one in the storyboard.

The sender is the instigating object (e.g. the button that is causing the segue).

#Demo

Psychologist

- This is all best understood via demonstration

- We will create a new Psychologist MVC

- The Psychologist will reveal his diagnosis by segueing to the Happiness MVC

- We'll put the MVCs into navigation controllers inside split view controllers

- That way, it will work on both iPad and iPhone devices



#Popover
###Popovers pop an entire MVC over the rest of the screen

###Popovers are not quite the same as these other combiners
Tab Bar, Split View and Navigation Controllers are UIViewControllers, popovers are not

###Seguing to a popover works almost exactly the same though

You still ctrl-drag, you still have an identifier, you still get to prepare

###Things to note when preparing for a popover segue

All segues are managed via a UIPresentationController (but we're not going to cover that)

But we are going to talk about a popover's UIPresentationController

It can tell you what caused the popover to appear (a bar button item or just a rectangle)

And it can let you control how the popover is presented

For example, you can control what direction the popover's arrow is allowed to point

Or you can control how a popover adapts to different sizes classes (e.g. iPad vs iPhone)


#Popover Prepare

Here's a prepareForSegue that prepares for a Popover segue

```swift
func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: AnyObject?) {
  if let identifier = segue.identifier {
    switch identifier {
      case "Do Something in a Popover Segue":
      if let vc = segue.destinationViewController as? MyController {
        if let ppc = vc.popoverPresentationController {
          ppc.permittedArrowDirections = UIPopoverArrowDirection.Any  
           //We can use it to set some properties that will control how the popover pops up
          ppc.delegate = self
          //And we can control the presentation by setting ourself (the Controller) as the delegate
        }
        // more preparation here
      }
      default: break
    }
  }
}
```
One thing that is different is that we are retrieving the popover's presentation controller

#Popover Presentation Controller

###What can we control as the presentation controller's delegate?

One very interesting thing is how a popover "adapts" to different sizes

By default, it will present on compact sizes Modally (i.e. take over the whole screen)

But the delegate can control this "adaptation" behavior, either by preventing it …

```swift
func adaptivePresentationStyleForPresentationController(UIPresentationController)
-> UIModalPresentationStyle
{
  return UIModalPresentationStyle.None // don't adapt (default is .FullScreen)
}
```

… or by allowing the full screen presentation to happen, but modifying the MVC that is put up …

```swift
func presentationController(UIPresentationController, 
viewControllerForAdaptivePresentationStyle: UIModalPresentatinoStyle) -> UIViewController?
{
  // return a UIViewController to use (e.g. wrap a Navigation Controller around your MVC)
}
```


#Popover Size
###Important Popover Issue: Size

A popover will be made pretty large unless someone tells it otherwise.

The MVC being presented knows best what it's "preferred" size inside a popover would be.

It expresses that via this property in itself (i.e. in the Controller of the MVC being presented) …
```swift
var preferredContentSize: CGSize
```
The MVC is not guaranteed to be that size, but the system will try its best. 


#Demo
###Popover in Psychologist

  Add a popover that shows the patient's diagnostic history
