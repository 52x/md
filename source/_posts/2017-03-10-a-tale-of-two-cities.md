实在是对这段话喜欢的不得了，而且随着慢慢的老去，随着时事迁易，对这句话的新的认识也屡屡冒出心头，特摘录于此，供自己闲洽之时慢慢审读品析之

> **It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, **
>
> **it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, **
>
> **it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, **
>
> **it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, **
>
> **it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, **
>
> **we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, **
>
> **we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way **
>
> **– in short, the period was so far like the present period, **
>
> **that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, **
>
> **for good or for evil, **
>
> **in the superlative degree of comparison only.**

当然也有结尾的那句

> **It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; **
>
> **it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.**
